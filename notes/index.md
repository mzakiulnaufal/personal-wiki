## LLM Knowledge Base

> [!note] Current Focus
> I enjoy the process of learning new things and sharing that knowledge with others. Right now, I'm particularly interested in Agentic Engineering and the field of educational sciences, where I'm exploring how emerging technologies can shape the way we teach and learn.

This is a personal, LLM-maintained knowledge base. The pattern is simple: I curate sources and ask questions; an LLM agent reads, summarizes, cross-references, and keeps a running synthesis here as durable, interlinked markdown pages. The goal is **accumulation** — every source ingested and every question asked makes the wiki a little richer, instead of disappearing into chat history.

If you're new to the idea, the [[wiki/Concepts/LLM Knowledge Systems|LLM Knowledge Systems]] page explains the pattern, and the [README](README.md) explains how this particular vault is set up.

## Start here

A few representative pages — pick one that catches your eye:

- [[wiki/Syntheses/ICS System|ICS System]] — high-level synthesis of the learning system that anchors the study notes.
- [[wiki/Techniques/Bear Hunter System|Bear Hunter System]] — practical encoding workflow built around Aim, Shoot, and Skin.
- [[wiki/Techniques/Spaced Interleaved Retrieval|Spaced Interleaved Retrieval]] — retrieval system for recall, spacing, interleaving, and gap repair.
- [[wiki/Red Team/Red Teaming|Red Teaming]] — decision-support principles from the Red Team handbook and Army/UFMCS tradition.
- [[wiki/Concepts/Agentic Engineering|Agentic Engineering]] — best practices for building with LLM agents.

> [!tip] How to navigate
> Use **Search** in the top-left, **Explorer** to browse by folder, or the **Graph** in the right sidebar to see how pages connect. Every page has backlinks at the bottom.
